This technique can be used with a special \"pear-shaped\" HMS locking carabiner, or any locking carabiner wide enough to take two turns of the rope.  The Munter Hitch creates friction by having the rope rub on itself and on the object it has been wrapped around. There is no static friction on any part of the rope as it is a continuously moving knot. One very useful aspect of the Munter is its reversibility; it can be pulled from either side of the rope and it still works just as effectively.","history":"In the late 1950's, three Italian climbers, Mario Bisaccia, Franco Garda and Pietro Gilardoni developed a new belay technique called the \"Mezzo Barcaiolo\" or MB for short. The \"Munter Hitch\" name comes from the the Swiss mountain guide, Werner Munter, who popularized its use in mountaineering in the 1970's.  Despite Werner being the namesake for the Munter Hitch, he was better known for his work on avalanche terrain risk assessment and avalanche education. The Munter is also known as \"HMS\", the abbreviation for the German term \"Halbmastwurfsicherung\", meaning half clove hitch belay.","alsoKnownAs":"Italian Hitch, Crossing Hitch, HMS, Tag Knot, MB","structure":"","strengthReliability":"One advantage of the Munter Hitch is it can more effectively dissipate heat than a belay device because no two surfaces of the rope are in contact with each other for more than an instant. However, it places more bends in a rope than other belay methods, and creates significantly more friction on the outer sheath. It can also introduce significant twists to the rope.  The friction of the rope against the screw on the carabiner can cause the screw to undo and the carabiner to open, potentially weakening the strength of the carabiner, or allowing the rope to escape the carabiner completely.","abok":"#1818","note":""},"related":["Super Munter","Munter Mule","Clove Hitch (Two Loops)","Backhand Hitch","Ossel Hitch","Two Half Hitches"],"classification":{"type":["Hitches"],"foundIn":["Arborist","Caving","Climbing","Fire & Rescue","Military"]}},{"id":"muntermuleoverhand","name":"Munter Mule","cover":"munter-mule.webp","aliases":["Munter Mule Overhand","MMO"],"description":"Lockable hitch for securing and releasing a loaded rope during rappelling.","animation":{"drawingAnimation":{"spriteData":"muntermuleoverhand.json","spriteImage":"muntermuleoverhand.png"},"rotation360":{"spriteData":"muntermuleoverhand360.json","spriteImage":"muntermuleoverhand360.png"}},"details":{"usage":"The Munter Mule is a releasable contingency rigging system that combines a Munter Hitch with an additional locking component, the \"Mule,\" to secure the hitch in place.

It was initially used in Scottish gill nets, which are fishing nets designed to catch fish by their gills as they try to swim through. The knot was employed to tie small lines to the larger ropes that supported the net.

The term \"Prusik\" refers to both the loop of cord and the hitch itself, and the action of using it is referred to as \"prusiking.\" Tied by wrapping the loop of cord around the main rope several times, the Prusik is most effective when the cord is smaller in diameter than the rope. Its reliability and ease of use make it a fundamental knot for climbers and rescuers.","history":"The Prusik Hitch is named for its alleged inventor, Austrian mountaineer Dr. Karl Prusik. It was shown in a 1931 Austrian mountaineering manual for rope ascending. It was used on several mountaineering routes of the era to ascend the final summit peak, where a rope could be thrown over the top and anchored so that climbers could attain the summit by prusiking up the other side of the rope. Although the Prusik Climb technique may be seen as outdated by some, the US Army still includes it in its annual Best Ranger competition. Rangers in the competition routinely make it up a 90 foot rope in under a minute.","alsoKnownAs":"Prusik Hitch, Middle of the Rope Prusik","structure":"One component of the Prusik Knot is the Prusik Loop. This loop can be made using a short section of rope joined by a Double Fisherman's Knot. Alternatively, the loop may be purchased, already formed, from climbing shops. Due to its symmetric nature, Prusik hitches have the advantage of working in both directions. Most mechanical rope-grabs work like a ratchet, moving freely up the rope, but grabbing when a load is placed down on them. Traditional Prusiks will grab when pulled by the tail, either up or down, and will slide either way when pushed by the barrel.","strengthReliability":"Prusiks provide a strong attachment that will not damage or break the rope.  Prusiks are ineffective upon frozen wet ropes. This is due to the necessity of friction for the Prusik to function.  As a general rule, the diameter of the cord used in these types of friction hitches should be should be no more than 70% the diameter of the primary climbing line.

Art: The Trefoil Knot is named after the three-leaf clover (or Trefoil) plant.  The Trefoil is a common motif in iconography and the visual arts. For example, the common form of the Celtic Triquetra symbol is a Trefoil, as are some versions of the Germanic Valknut.  The Triquetra is often found in Insular art, most notably metal work and in ancient manuscripts like the Book of Kells. It is also found in similar artwork on Celtic crosses and slabs from the early Christian period. In modern art, the woodcut “Knots” by M. C. Escher depicts three trefoil knots whose solid forms are twisted in different ways.Religion: The Trefoil/Triquetra has been used as a singular symbol for the past two centuries by Celtic Christians, Pagans and agnostics as a sign of special things and persons that are threefold. The Triquetra has been used extensively on Christian sculpture, vestments, book arts and stained glass. It has been used on the title page and binding of some editions of the New King James Version of the Bible.Mathematics: In topology, a branch of mathematics, the Trefoil knot is the simplest example of a nontrivial knot (meaning that it is not possible to “untie” a Trefoil knot in three dimensions without cutting it.).

To further confuse things, there is evidence that the Triple Roll knot has also been called the Franciscan Friar's Knot. Both the Franciscan Friar's Knot (Triple Overhand and Triple Roll variant) and the Capuchin Knot have three turns that represent the Franciscan vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity.

The Yosemite finish can be applied to other bowline variants, such as the Double Bowline.","strengthReliability":"Due to the extra wrap and tuck, the Yosemite Bowline's security is enhanced and prevents the Bowline 'capsizing' to form a highly dangerous slipknot. For additional safety, it is recommended that the Yosemite Bowline have a stopper knot such as a Double Overhand Knot (not shown in the animation). A stopper knot, while serving to keep the loose end tidy, will not only help to prevent failure of the primary knot, but also act as a secondary safety knot itself. It is sometimes said that if enough of a tail is left to tie a stopper knot, the stopper becomes unnecessary. The tail should be a minimum of 40 - 60 cm depending on the thickness of the rope.","abok":"","note":""},"related":["Bowline","Figure Eight Follow Through","Scott's Locked Bowline","Double Bowline","Edwards Bowline","Rethreaded Bowline"],"classification":{"type":["Loops"],"foundIn":["Arborist","Caving","Climbing"]}},{"id":"yucatan","name":"Yucatan Knot","cover":"yucatan-knot.webp","aliases":["Worm Knot","Reverse Albright Knot","Reverse Knot"],"description":"Strong fishing knot for joining light line to heavier shock leader.","animation":{"drawingAnimation":{"spriteData":"yucatan.json","spriteImage":"yucatan.png"},"rotation360":{"spriteData":"yucatan360.json","spriteImage":"yucatan360.png"}},"details":{"usage":"The Yucatan Knot is a fishing knot used to join lines of different diameters, particularly for tying heavier shock leaders to lighter main lines.

The number of wraps is dependent on the type of line used: 5 - 6 wraps for a monofilament main line or 10 - 12 wraps for a braid main line around the leader line.","strengthReliability":"The Yucatan is considered one of the strongest light-to-heavy line splices.","abok":"","note":"As with most fishing knots, it is important to lubricate the Yucatan while tightening. Applying water or saliva reduces friction and prevents heat buildup, which can weaken the line, especially with monofilament and fluorocarbon lines.
