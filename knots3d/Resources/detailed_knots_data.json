It was one of the knots identified among the possessions of Ötzi the Iceman mummy, who lived around 3300 BC near the current border between Austria and Italy. In modern times the knot is commonly used for rappelling. American climbers, presumably believing the knot to be used only in hay bales or otherwise too prone to \"flyping\" (inversion by capsizing), came to refer to it as the \"European Death Knot\", abbreviated as EDK.

Due to Ashley's statement and despite the American nickname, \"European Death Knot\" (See History above), the Flat Overhand Bend does present  advantages for use in rappels. Because the knot is offset from the axis of tension, it can slide more easily over rough surfaces than other knots. Along with its comparatively small size, this aids in rope retrieval by reducing its chance of getting stuck on edges, in cracks, or descent equipment. Since a stuck rope on a descent represents a serious hazard to climbers, these advantages, along with ease of tying, have led to its popularity. It is recommended by some sources with the caveats that the tails be left very long (greater than half a meter or 18 inches), the knot be carefully dressed and fully tightened by pulling individually on all four strands, and then subjected only to moderate rappelling loads.","abok":"#1410","note":""},"related":["Overhand Knot","Water Knot","Offset Figure Eight Bend","Sheet Bend","Figure Eight Bend","Loop Knot"],"classification":{"type":["Bends"],"foundIn":["Climbing"]}},{"id":"flemishflake","name":"Flemish Flake","cover":"flemish-flake.webp","aliases":["Cheese","ABOK #3102"],"description":"Rope coil in a flat spiral for neat, temporary storage on docks.","animation":{"drawingAnimation":{"spriteData":"flemishflake.json","spriteImage":"flemishflake.png"},"rotation360":{"spriteData":"flemishflake360.json","spriteImage":"flemishflake360.png"}},"details":{"usage":"A Flemish Flake is a spiral coil of rope upon the deck of a boat.  \"Flake\" is a sailor term for a turn in an ordinary coil, or for a complete tier in a flat coil.

Hanson's patent outlined several variations of his loop knot, including a double loop version, a running knot version, and a bend version for joining two ropes. The patent is noteworthy for a couple of reasons: (1) very few knots have been patented, making this one of the rare cases, and (2) Hanson uniquely described the knot’s parts using the twelve points of the Scout Law (trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent — though no mention of \"hungry\").The Hanson Loop was later included in the BSA publication \"Knots and How to Tie Them\", helping introduce the knot to a broader audience within scouting. The BSA is known for teaching practical outdoor skills, and the Hanson Loop was highlighted as a versatile and easy-to-learn knot, ideal for camping and pioneering.

One of its key advantages is the ability to tie it using either cord or webbing, offering flexibility based on the environment and available materials. Compared to the Prusik, the Klemheist generally slides upward with greater ease, making it a preferred choice for upward mobility during climbing or rescue.","history":"The Klemheist derives its name from the Dutch word klem, meaning 'clamp.'

A key advantage of the Kreh Loop is its strength: it doesn’t slip and often tests close to 100% of the unknotted line strength.

The number of turns made in the knot depends on the strength of the fishing line being used.","strengthReliability":"While the Kreh Loop is not quite as strong as the Rapala Knot, it retains a significant amount of the line's rated strength. Often, the fishing line itself will break before the knot does, making it a reliable choice for a variety of fishing conditions. The Kreh Loop is also an improvement over the Uni-Knot (Duncan Loop), which both tightens under pressure and has inferior strength.","abok":"","note":"As with most fishing knots, it is important to lubricate the Kreh Loop while tightening.

Art: The Trefoil Knot is named after the three-leaf clover (or Trefoil) plant.  The Trefoil is a common motif in iconography and the visual arts. For example, the common form of the Celtic Triquetra symbol is a Trefoil, as are some versions of the Germanic Valknut.  The Triquetra is often found in Insular art, most notably metal work and in ancient manuscripts like the Book of Kells. It is also found in similar artwork on Celtic crosses and slabs from the early Christian period. In modern art, the woodcut “Knots” by M. C. Escher depicts three trefoil knots whose solid forms are twisted in different ways.Religion: The Trefoil/Triquetra has been used as a singular symbol for the past two centuries by Celtic Christians, Pagans and agnostics as a sign of special things and persons that are threefold. The Triquetra has been used extensively on Christian sculpture, vestments, book arts and stained glass. It has been used on the title page and binding of some editions of the New King James Version of the Bible.Mathematics: In topology, a branch of mathematics, the Trefoil knot is the simplest example of a nontrivial knot (meaning that it is not possible to “untie” a Trefoil knot in three dimensions without cutting it.).

To further confuse things, there is evidence that the Triple Roll knot has also been called the Franciscan Friar's Knot. Both the Franciscan Friar's Knot (Triple Overhand and Triple Roll variant) and the Capuchin Knot have three turns that represent the Franciscan vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity.

The tail should be a minimum of 40 - 60 cm depending on the thickness of the rope.","abok":"","note":""},"related":["Bowline","Figure Eight Follow Through","Scott's Locked Bowline","Double Bowline","Edwards Bowline","Rethreaded Bowline"],"classification":{"type":["Loops"],"foundIn":["Arborist","Caving","Climbing"]}},{"id":"yucatan","name":"Yucatan Knot","cover":"yucatan-knot.webp","aliases":["Worm Knot","Reverse Albright Knot","Reverse Knot"],"description":"Strong fishing knot for joining light line to heavier shock leader.","animation":{"drawingAnimation":{"spriteData":"yucatan.json","spriteImage":"yucatan.png"},"rotation360":{"spriteData":"yucatan360.json","spriteImage":"yucatan360.png"}},"details":{"usage":"The Yucatan Knot is a fishing knot used to join lines of different diameters, particularly for tying heavier shock leaders to lighter main lines. Known for its strength, it is ideal for saltwater fishing. The Yucatan Knot creates a smooth, streamlined connection that passes easily through rod guides and is regarded as stronger than similar knots like the Albright Special and Slim Beauty.","history":"The Yucatan Knot is believed to have been first developed in the sport fishing waters off the coast of Cancun, Mexico, near the tip of the Yucatan Peninsula.","alsoKnownAs":"Worm Knot, Reverse Albright Knot, Reverse Knot","structure":"There is some variance in the number of wraps used for the Yucatan Knot. The number of wraps is dependent on the type of line used: 5 - 6 wraps for a monofilament main line or 10 - 12 wraps for a braid main line around the leader line.","strengthReliability":"The Yucatan is considered one of the strongest light-to-heavy line splices.","abok":"","note":"As with most fishing knots, it is important to lubricate the Yucatan while tightening. Applying water or saliva reduces friction and prevents heat buildup, which can weaken the line, especially with monofilament and fluorocarbon lines.
