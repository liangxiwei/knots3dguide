        "usage": "The Munter Hitch is a simple knot, commonly used by climbers and cavers as part of a life-lining or belay system.  This technique can be used with a special \"pear-shaped\" HMS locking carabiner, or any locking carabiner wide enough to take two turns of the rope.  The Munter Hitch creates friction by having the rope rub on itself and on the object it has been wrapped around. There is no static friction on any part of the rope as it is a continuously moving knot. One very useful aspect of the Munter is its reversibility; it can be pulled from either side of the rope and it still works just as effectively.",
        "history": "In the late 1950's, three Italian climbers, Mario Bisaccia, Franco Garda and Pietro Gilardoni developed a new belay technique called the \"Mezzo Barcaiolo\" or MB for short. The \"Munter Hitch\" name comes from the the Swiss mountain guide, Werner Munter, who popularized its use in mountaineering in the 1970's.  Despite Werner being the namesake for the Munter Hitch, he was better known for his work on avalanche terrain risk assessment and avalanche education. The Munter is also known as \"HMS\", the abbreviation for the German term \"Halbmastwurfsicherung\", meaning half clove hitch belay.",
        "alsoKnownAs": "Italian Hitch, Crossing Hitch, HMS, Tag Knot, MB",
        "structure": "",
        "strengthReliability": "One advantage of the Munter Hitch is it can more effectively dissipate heat than a belay device because no two surfaces of the rope are in contact with each other for more than an instant. However, it places more bends in a rope than other belay methods, and creates significantly more friction on the outer sheath. It can also introduce significant twists to the rope.  The friction of the rope against the screw on the carabiner can cause the screw to undo and the carabiner to open, potentially weakening the strength of the carabiner, or allowing the rope to escape the carabiner completely.",

It requires no additional hardware besides a carabiner. It is commonly used for releasable rappels and can be released even under tension. This knot is particularly useful in scenarios where temporarily locking off a rope is necessary, such as during rescue operations or belaying. The Mule knot secures the Munter Hitch, preventing the rope from slipping while allowing for easy release when needed. It also enables the climber to go hands-free, earning it the nickname \"the rescuer's extra hand.\" The Munter Mule Overhand is often referred to as the \"MMO\" for short.

Proper lubrication allows the knot to cinch smoothly and evenly, preserving the lineâ€™s strength and ensuring a more reliable knot."
